xruna README


For usage information, execute the command: man xruna
For a log of changes, see: /usr/share/doc/xruna/CHANGELOG

The first time xruna is executed it will create for the current user:

Configuration file: ~/.config/xruna/xruna.conf
Favourites file: ~/.config/xruna/xruna.fav

xruna also comes with:

A script which can replace freedesktop.org's 'xdg-open': /usr/share/doc/xruna/xdg-open
Copy this to somewhere on the user's PATH before /usr/bin, for example /usr/local/bin,
or rename the current /usr/bin/xdg-open and run the script via a symbolic link.

Three desktop files:

1) xruna.desktop         - Run any application and optionally open objects
2) xruna-assoc.desktop   - Opens objects with associated applications
3) xruna-desktop.desktop - Run desktop application files
